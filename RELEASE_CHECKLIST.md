# üöÄ RoleReady: Pre-Launch & Security Checklist

This comprehensive checklist outlines the remaining steps to prepare RoleReady for a secure, robust, and successful launch, enabling payment acceptance and ensuring user trust.

## üéØ Phase 1: Frontend Completion & Polish (Current Focus)

*   **Interactive Functionality (High Priority)**
    *   [ ] **Library Actions**: Implement full functionality for "Resume," "Edit," "Download," and "Delete" buttons on the `/library` page.
    *   [ ] **Generate Form**: Add robust client-side form validation and error handling for the job description input on `/generate`.
    *   [ ] **Quiz Mode**: Implement session loading from the library, a settings panel, and persistence of quiz progress.
    *   [ ] **Account Settings**: Develop profile editing forms, plan upgrade flows (frontend only, linking to payment initiation), and notification toggles.
*   **Missing Pages (Medium Priority)**
    *   [ ] **Static Pages**: Create complete content for `/terms`, `/privacy`, and `/support`.
    *   [ ] **Onboarding Modal**: Implement the first-time user setup flow (job focus, experience level, prep preferences).
    *   [ ] **Error Pages**: Design and implement user-friendly 404 and general error pages.
*   **Frontend Polish (Medium Priority)**
    *   [ ] **Form Validation**: Ensure consistent and clear validation messages across all forms.
    *   [ ] **Loading States**: Implement loading indicators for all asynchronous operations to improve UX.
    *   [ ] **Toast Notifications**: Integrate a toast notification system for user feedback (e.g., "Session Saved!", "Upgrade Successful!").
    *   [ ] **Accessibility (A11y)**: Conduct an accessibility audit and implement improvements (keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, color contrast).
    *   [ ] **Mobile Menu**: Ensure the mobile navigation menu is fully functional and intuitive.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Phase 2: Backend Integration & Core Functionality

*   **Authentication (Clerk Integration - Critical)**
    *   [ ] Replace mock authentication with **live Clerk integration**.
    *   [ ] Configure Clerk for Google and LinkedIn OAuth.
    *   [ ] Securely handle user sessions and tokens.
    *   [ ] Implement Clerk webhooks for user lifecycle events (e.g., new user creation, profile updates).
*   **Database (ConvexDB - Critical)**
    *   [ ] Define and implement the **ConvexDB schema** for all necessary data (users, job descriptions, questions, answers, sessions, usage data, payment records).
    *   [ ] Implement **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for all core data models.
    *   [ ] Ensure data validation and integrity at the database level.
*   **AI Integration (OpenAI - Critical)**
    *   [ ] Develop secure **API endpoints** for OpenAI integration (question generation, mock interviewer).
    *   [ ] Implement **rate limiting and cost management** for OpenAI API calls.
    *   [ ] Handle potential API errors and timeouts gracefully.
    *   [ ] Ensure **prompt engineering** best practices for optimal AI responses.
*   **Usage Tracking & Limits (Critical)**
    *   [ ] Implement robust **server-side usage tracking** based on user plans (free, starter, pro, elite).
    *   [ ] Enforce **usage limits** for AI questions, saved sessions, etc.
    *   [ ] Develop logic for **upgrade modals/banners** triggered by usage limits.
*   **Payment System (Stripe Integration - Critical)**
    *   [ ] Integrate **Stripe Checkout** for subscription management (Free, Starter, Pro, Elite plans).
    *   [ ] Implement **Stripe webhooks** for critical events (successful payments, failed payments, subscription changes, refunds).
    *   [ ] Securely store and manage customer and subscription data in ConvexDB (referencing Stripe IDs).
    *   [ ] Develop **upgrade/downgrade logic** and prorations.
    *   [ ] Implement **billing history** display for users.

## üîí Phase 3: Security & Compliance (Ongoing & Critical)

*   **Authentication & Authorization**
    *   [ ] **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Ensure users can only access resources and features permitted by their plan.
    *   [ ] **Session Management**: Secure session handling (e.g., short-lived tokens, refresh tokens, proper invalidation).
    *   [ ] **Input Validation**: Implement server-side input validation for all user-submitted data to prevent injection attacks (XSS, SQLi, etc.).
*   **Data Security**
    *   [ ] **Encryption in Transit**: Ensure all communication uses HTTPS/SSL.
    *   [ ] **Encryption at Rest**: Verify ConvexDB's data encryption at rest.
    *   [ ] **Sensitive Data Handling**: Never store sensitive user data (e.g., raw passwords, full credit card numbers) directly. Rely on Clerk and Stripe for this.
    *   [ ] **Data Minimization**: Only collect and store data that is absolutely necessary.
*   **API Security**
    *   [ ] **API Key Management**: Securely manage API keys for OpenAI, Clerk, Stripe (e.g., environment variables, secret management services).
    *   [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Implement server-side rate limiting on all public and authenticated API endpoints to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks.
    *   [ ] **CORS Configuration**: Properly configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
*   **Payment Security & Fraud Prevention (Crucial)**
    *   [ ] **Stripe Webhook Signature Verification**: Always verify Stripe webhook signatures to prevent spoofed events.
    *   [ ] **Server-Side Payment Logic**: All payment-related logic (e.g., plan activation, usage updates) must be handled server-side, never client-side.
    *   [ ] **Prevent Bypassing**: Implement robust checks to ensure users cannot bypass payment gates to access premium features. This includes:
        *   Server-side verification of user's active plan before granting access to features.
        *   Server-side enforcement of usage limits.
        *   Regular reconciliation of user plans with Stripe subscription status.
    *   [ ] **PCI DSS Compliance**: While Stripe handles most of this, ensure your integration practices align with PCI DSS requirements (e.g., never handling raw card data).
*   **General Security Practices**
    *   [ ] **Dependency Security**: Regularly audit and update third-party libraries and dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   [ ] **Error Handling & Logging**: Implement secure error handling (avoid leaking sensitive information) and comprehensive logging for security monitoring.
    *   [ ] **Security Headers**: Configure appropriate HTTP security headers (e.g., Content Security Policy, X-Frame-Options).
    *   [ ] **Regular Security Audits/Pen-testing**: Consider professional security audits or penetration testing before launch and periodically thereafter.
    *   [ ] **Incident Response Plan**: Develop a basic plan for responding to security incidents.
*   **Privacy & Compliance**
    *   [ ] **GDPR/CCPA Compliance**: Ensure data collection, storage, and processing practices comply with relevant privacy regulations.
    *   [ ] **Privacy Policy & Terms of Service**: Ensure these documents are legally sound and clearly accessible.

## üöÄ Phase 4: Deployment & Infrastructure

*   [ ] **Environment Setup**: Configure production, staging, and development environments.
*   [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment for automated testing and deployment.
*   [ ] **Monitoring & Alerting**: Implement application performance monitoring (APM), error tracking, and alerting (e.g., for critical errors, security events, payment failures).
*   [ ] **Scalability**: Review and optimize the application for scalability under load.
*   [ ] **Backup & Recovery**: Establish data backup and disaster recovery procedures for ConvexDB.
*   [ ] **Domain & DNS**: Configure custom domain and DNS settings.
*   [ ] **CDN**: Utilize a Content Delivery Network for static assets to improve performance.

## ‚úÖ Phase 5: Testing & Quality Assurance

*   [ ] **Unit Tests**: Write comprehensive unit tests for critical functions (backend logic, utility functions).
*   [ ] **Integration Tests**: Develop integration tests for API endpoints and database interactions.
*   [ ] **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Implement E2E tests for core user flows (sign-up, question generation, payment, account management).
*   [ ] **Performance Testing**: Conduct load testing to ensure the application performs well under expected user traffic.
*   [ ] **Security Testing**: Perform vulnerability scanning and basic penetration testing.
*   [ ] **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Conduct UAT with a small group of beta testers.

## üìà Phase 6: Pre-Launch & Marketing

*   [ ] **Analytics Integration**: Set up analytics (e.g., Google Analytics, Mixpanel) to track user behavior.
*   [ ] **SEO Optimization**: Implement basic SEO best practices for public pages.
